# JavaScript Exercises
This repository contains solutions to common JavaScript exercises, focusing on loops, conditionals, and string manipulation.

## 1. Triangle Pattern
Write a loop that makes seven calls to `console.log` to output a triangle.\

## 2. FizzBuzz
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of 3, print `"fuzz"` instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, print `"Buzz"`. For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print `"FizzBuzz"`.\

## 3. Chessboard Pattern
Write a program that creates a string representing an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid, there is either a space (`' '`) or a `#` character, forming a chessboard pattern.\

[NOTE] ChatGPT's this solution is way better, because console.log() is used once, and this does not affect the performance much, as opposed to mine, which really slows the program down.
